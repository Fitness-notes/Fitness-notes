## Firebase Setup üî•

To make sure Firebase authentication and Firestore work correctly:

1. Set up a new project on [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. Add your Firebase configuration to the appropriate file in the project (e.g., firebaseConfig.js). The configuration looks like:
    ```bash
    const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };

3. Enable the desired authentication methods in the Firebase Console.
